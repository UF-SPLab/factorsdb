# About

<p class="lead">FactorsDB is an open-source repository of experiments that
run natively in a web browser.</p>

FactorsDB was created to curate a collection of high-quality browser-based
experiments for classroom demonstrations. The experiments require no additional
software to run, making it easy for instructors and students to use the
experiments in a classroom setting. Anyone is free to use, contribute to, or
modify the experiments on this site. The site is hosted on GitHub and the entire
contents of the site is a
[GitHub repository](http://github.com/jodeleeuw/factorsdb).

All of the experiments on FactorsDB are created with the
[jspsych](http://www.jspsych.org) experiment library. jspsych is a free,
open-source JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments that run in a
web browser.

FactorsDB was created by [Josh de Leeuw](http://pages.iu.edu/~jodeleeu) at
Indiana University.
